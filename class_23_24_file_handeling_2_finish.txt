                                File Handeling-2
                                ----------------
Writing data to text files:-
---------------------------
we can write character data to the text files by using 2 methods

1.write(str)
2.writelines(list of lines)

write:-

f = open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","w")
f.write("Scodeen is best\n")
f.write("Mode in which file is opened\n")
f.write("readable\n")
print("Successfully")
f.close()

override
--------
if in a file some data are exits then new data in write mode was override pervious data.

'''f = open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","w")
f.write("Scodeen is best\n")
f.write("Mode in which file is opened\n")
f.write("readable\n")
print("Successfully")
f.close()'''

f = open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","w")
f.write("Name of file")



2.writelines
------------

contain the data from list of string.

#writelines

f= open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","w")
list = ["Swadhin\n ","Swagat\n"," Chiiny\n ","Mukesh\n"]
f.writelines(list)
f.close()

Note:-While write data by using write() methods,compulsory we have to provide line separator(\n),otherwise total data should be written to a single line..


Writing data to text files but in Append(a) mode:-
-----------------------------------------------

Open a file,append is won't override exitsing data.if the specified file is not avaialble then append mode create a new file.

1.write(str)
2.writelines(list of string)


f = open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","a")
f.write("\n \n \n")
f.write("Scodeen is best\n")
f.write("Mode in which file is opened\n")
f.write("readable\n")
print("Successfully")
f.close()


Closing a File:-

After completing our operations on the file,It is highly recommended to close file,Otherwise when we will use this on onther program it's returns the error,For this we have to use close()

variable.close()


The with statement:-
------------------

The with statement can be used while oprning a file,we can use this to group file operation statements within a block.

Note:-

The advantage of with statement is it will take care closing of file,after completing all opeartions automatically even in the case of exception also,we are not required to close explicitly.

syntax:-

with open("file_path","mode") as variable_name:
	
	statements

ex:-

with open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","r") as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)
    print("is file Closed:-", f.closed)

print("is file Closed:-",f.closed)



The seek() and tell() methods:-
-----------------------------

tell():-

We can use tell() method to return current position of the cursor(file pointer) from beginning of the file.The position(index) of first character in files is zerp just like string index.

ex:-
with open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","r") as f:
    print(f.tell())
    print(f.read(2))
    print(f.tell())
    print(f.read(5))
    print(f.tell())

ex:-

0
Sw
2
adhin
7


seek():-
------

We can use seek() method to move cursor to specified location.

syntax:-

variable.seek(offset,fromwhere)


offset represents the number of positions

0---> From beginning of file(default value)
1---> From current position-----(only python2)
2---> From end of the file.-----(only python2)


ex:-

with open("D:\\SCODEEN\\testing_17_18_python\\abc.txt","a") as f:
    text = f.read()
    print(text)
    print("The current cursor position:-",f.tell())
    f.seek(17)
    print("The current cursor position-2:-", f.tell())
    f.write("   Gems   ")


Zipping and UNzipping files:-
-----------------------------

It is very common requirement to zip and unzip files.

The main advantages are:-

1.To improve memory utilization
2.we can reduce transport time.


To perform zip and unsip opeartion.Python contains one in-built module zip file

This module contains a raw(pure) class:- ZipFile


To create Zip File:-
-------------------

We have to create ZipFile class object with name of the zip file,mode and constant ZIP_DEFLATED. This constant ewpresents we are creating zip file.

zipping:- mode(write)
syntax:-

variable = ZipFile("path","w","ZIP_DEFLATED")



To create UnZIp file:-
---------------------

constant:- ZIP_STORED

unzipping:- mode(read)

Once we created ZipFile object for UnZip opeartion,we can get all file names present in that zip file by using namelist() method.

variable = stored_variable.namelist()
